Besides being known as an internationally-known state, you can find lots of sightseeing spots in Malacca such as the St. Paul’s Hill a.k.a. A’Famosa, the Jonker Walk along the famous Jonker Street, experience the Baba Nyonya culture, visiting the infamous clock tower of Stadthuys, 18th-century Anglican Christ Church, Cheng Ho Cultural Museum, Maritime Museum, Hang Tuah’s Well, Kite Museum and the list goes on and on. As you can tell from that few mentioned spots, it is without a doubt a state that is rich in culture and history. It will probably require you to spend more than just one day to soak in as much of Malacca as you can, so best to dedicate at least your two-days weekend for it.

You can customise your very own Mamee snack souvenirs at Mamee Monster Factory, go fishing off the kelongs of Pantai Siring, picking rambutans at the Melaka Tropical Fruit Farm, releasing baby Hawksbill turtles back into the sea, stand on the glass panels 42-floors above ground at Shore @ Melaka, just to name a few.

Besides, you only need to hop on a bus to Melaka to create beautiful moments to upload to your social media accounts that will have your followers feel green with envy. Going back to the topic of food, you should know that Melaka is also known to be a food haven, so that is another reason to give yourself that extra day of accommodation to return home feeling absolutely satisfied.

Meanwhile, if you’re on a bus that departs in the evening, the bus is comfortable enough to get a decent bit of rest, especially when traveling on a luxury express coach.

It goes without saying that you’ll need to have your passport on hand and, for foreign travelers, that you will need to secure visas ahead of time if necessary. Thankfully, the process goes very quickly as both Singaporean and Malaysian governments have worked hard to make the checks and immigration stops as efficient as possible. Once at the border, passengers will need to get off the bus to present their passports to the immigration officers. After this, passengers will return to the bus and then custom checks will be conducted on all luggage on the bus. The entire process rarely takes over 15 minutes and you’ll be on your way to your final destination in Singapore before you know it. Choose your desired dates and you’ll be selecting seats and on your way to Singapore in no time. Bon voyage!</p>";
